# Burger Application

## Description

This application uses a full CRUD environment using a mySQL database to store data.  The application loads with burger options alreadly inputed with two separate lists. One list allows you to click a button to eat the burger and it will move to the second list as devoured and you can remove the burger from the database by clicking the remove button. If you want to add new burgers to be devoured you can use the add a burger form at the bottom of the application. This application uses mysql, express, and express-handlebars.
